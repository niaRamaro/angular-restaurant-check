This small app consists of taking :
- recipe orders
- drink orders

### Recipe
We may choose between 3 recipes. Each recipe has its own ingredients. We may include/exclude ingredients from the recipe but at least one ingredient must be included.

### Drink
Drinks are made of a form that has :
- a name
- a number of order
- a price
For the sake of the demo, the name and the price can be edited.
If the total amount of drinks exceeds 100000, a discount of 20% is applied to the whole order.

The goal is to have those choices on the left and display the computed values of the order on the right.
